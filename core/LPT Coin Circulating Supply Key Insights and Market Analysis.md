# LPT Coin Circulating Supply: Key Insights and Market Analysis

## Understanding LPT Coin's Dynamic Supply Mechanism

LPT Coin (Livepeer Token) operates with a flexible supply model that adapts to network demands. As of the latest data, the circulating supply stands at 38,771,183 tokens. Unlike fixed-supply cryptocurrencies, Livepeer employs an adaptive issuance model designed to maintain network security and economic sustainability while balancing token holder interests.

### Evolution of LPT Coin Distribution

The token's journey began with a modest initial allocation of 100,000 tokens, primarily distributed through early funding rounds and team incentives. This strategic distribution helped establish the network's foundation while creating opportunities for initial supporters. Over time, the supply has expanded through protocol-driven emissions that reward network participants contributing to video transcoding infrastructure.

### Market Performance Metrics

Recent market data reveals:
- **24-hour Trading Volume**: $25,036,838 (down 34.10% from previous period)
- **Historical Price Range**: $0.3541 (lowest) to $99.03 (highest)
- **Current Value Positioning**: 94.83% below peak value but 1,347.12% above its lowest point
