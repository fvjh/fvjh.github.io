## **FreePay: A Pioneering Open-Source Payment Terminal**  

FreePay represents a significant leap in cryptocurrency transaction technology. By integrating an NFC reader and a merchant-facing screen, it enables seamless payments directly from crypto wallets like MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet. Users simply tap their mobile devices to complete transactions, bypassing costly intermediaries like Visa or Square.  

### **How FreePay Works**  
1. **Merchant Interface**: Sellers input the transaction amount via a dedicated app.  
2. **Customer Interaction**: Buyers confirm payments using their mobile wallets.  
3. **Open-Source Flexibility**: The system‚Äôs codebase allows developers to expand support for additional blockchains and wallets.  

> ‚ÄúWe should replace TradFi, not join them,‚Äù Robinson emphasizes, advocating for native crypto solutions over hybrid models.

## **Why Traditional Payment Processors Fall Short**  

Traditional payment systems impose fees that erode profit margins. For example:  
- **Visa/Mastercard**: 1‚Äì2% per transaction  
- **American Express**: 1.4‚Äì2.5% per transaction  
- **Square**: Additional 2.6% processing fees  

By contrast, blockchain-based solutions like Ethereum Layer 2 and Solana offer near-zero fees. FreePay leverages these low-cost networks to create a competitive edge for merchants and consumers.  

### **Comparison Table: Transaction Costs**  

| **Platform**       | **Average Fee** |  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
| Visa Credit Card    | 1‚Äì2%            |  
| Square Terminal     | 2.6% + fees     |  
| Ethereum Layer 2    | <$0.01          |  
| Solana              | <$0.001         |
