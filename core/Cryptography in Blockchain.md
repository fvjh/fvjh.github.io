## FAQ: Cryptography in Blockchain

**Q: Why is cryptography essential for blockchain security?**  
A: Cryptography ensures data integrity through hashing, enables secure transactions via digital signatures, and maintains privacy through encryption techniques. Without cryptographic foundations, blockchain's decentralized trust model would be impossible to achieve.

**Q: How do quantum computers threaten blockchain cryptography?**  
A: Quantum computers could potentially break ECDSA and RSA algorithms through Shor's algorithm. This has prompted research into post-quantum cryptographic standards that remain secure against quantum attacks.

**Q: What makes blockchain different from traditional databases?**  
A: Blockchain's cryptographic linking of data blocks creates an immutable ledger without requiring central authority. Traditional databases rely on access controls and centralized validation mechanisms.

**Q: How are cryptographic keys managed in blockchain systems?**  
A: Private keys are typically stored in encrypted wallet files or hardware security modules. Hierarchical deterministic wallets generate key trees from seed phrases, while multi-signature schemes require multiple approvals for transactions.

**Q: What role do hash functions play in blockchain mining?**  
A: Hash functions create unique block identifiers, enable proof-of-work difficulty adjustments, and ensure transaction immutability through Merkle tree structures. Miners compete to find valid nonce values meeting difficulty targets.
