## Frequently Asked Questions  

**Q1: What distinguishes Web 3.0 from previous internet generations?**  
Web 3.0 introduces decentralization through blockchain, enabling ownership of digital assets and data sovereignty. Unlike Web 2.0â€™s centralized platforms, users interact directly without intermediaries.  

**Q2: Is Brave Browser the only way to access Web 3.0?**  
While Brave provides a seamless experience, alternatives like Opera Crypto Browser and desktop wallets (e.g., MetaMask) also work. Braveâ€™s advantage lies in its integrated approach combining privacy and blockchain tools.  

**Q3: How secure is Web 3.0 browsing?**  
Security depends on user practices. Braveâ€™s ad-blocking and phishing protection reduce risks, but private key management remains criticalâ€”losing access means permanent asset loss.  

**Q4: Can I use Web 3.0 for everyday tasks?**  
Yes. DeFi platforms handle financial services, NFT marketplaces enable digital ownership, and decentralized social networks offer censorship-resistant communication.
