# New Policy Launch: Understanding Hong Kong's Cryptocurrency Platform Transition Period Arrangements

## Background

The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong released its Virtual Asset Trading Platform (VATP) licensing manual and transitional arrangements circular on May 31, 2023. This announcement marks the final preparation phase for the June 1, 2023 VATP license application process. The regulatory framework aims to establish comprehensive oversight for cryptocurrency platforms operating in Hong Kong's financial market.

## Key Transitional Arrangements

### Eligibility Criteria for Transition Period

Platforms meeting specific operational requirements before June 1, 2023, can continue operations under transitional arrangements:

1. **Genuine Business Presence** Requirements:
   - Must operate as a Hong Kong-registered company
   - Maintain physical office space in Hong Kong
   - Demonstrate local management and control
   - Employ Hong Kong-based key personnel
   - Show verifiable Hong Kong customer base and trading volume

*Important Note:* Merely registering a company in Hong Kong without actual local operations doesn't qualify. Employees must have been physically present in Hong Kong before June 1, 2023.

### License Application Timeline

Eligible platforms can obtain automatic licensing status by:
1. Submitting complete applications by February 29, 2024
2. Demonstrating full compliance with licensing regulations

**FAQ:**  
*What happens if my platform starts operations after June 1, 2023?*  
New platforms must secure official SFC licensing before commencing operations - no transitional arrangements apply.

## Personnel Transition Provisions

### Regulatory Officers (RO) & Responsible Individuals (LR)

Existing platform personnel fulfilling these roles before June 1, 2023, benefit from transitional provisions:
- Continue performing duties until May 31, 2024
- Must submit individual license applications by February 29, 2024
- Demonstrate regulatory compliance capabilities

**FAQ:**  
*How does SFC evaluate "active marketing" to Hong Kong residents?*  
Considered activities include targeted advertising campaigns, Chinese-language interfaces, HKD pricing, and dedicated outreach programs.

## Compliance Requirements

### Operational Standards

1. **Combined Licensing Recommendation:**  
   Platforms should apply for both VATP and Types 1 & 7 licenses due to crypto asset classification fluidity

2. **Ongoing Reporting Obligations:**  
   - Monthly activity reports in SFC-prescribed formats
   - Annual independent audits (first report due 18 months post-licensing)
   - Mandatory compliance with local laws for overseas operations

### Financial Requirements

- Minimum paid-up capital: HK$5 million
- Liquidity reserves: HK$3 million
- Additional operational funds covering 12 months of expenses

### Infrastructure Specifications

- Trustee custodians must operate as standalone entities
- Data centers require SFC approval (no location restrictions)

**FAQ:**  
*What constitutes "non-compliance experience" for licensing?*  
Relevant fintech experience and regulated environment work (even without formal licensing) may be considered.

## Strategic Implementation Guidance

### Application Best Practices

1. **Early Submission Advantage:**  
   SFC allows application revisions - submit well before the February 29, 2024 deadline

2. **Resourcing Considerations:**  
   Multiple responsible officers recommended due to operational complexity

3. **Marketing Compliance:**  
   Platforms targeting Hong Kong residents through Chinese-language content or HKD pricing must obtain licensing
