# Crypto-Related Stocks Regain Momentum: Policy Support and Market Expectations Fuel Investor Sentiment

## Policy Shifts Reshape Global Crypto Landscape  

Recent months have witnessed a renewed surge in global capital markets' focus on blockchain technology and digital assets. The convergence of regulatory advancements and shifting market dynamics has reignited investor interest in crypto-related equities. From Washington D.C. to Hong Kong, key developments suggest the industry may finally transition from regulatory ambiguity to institutionalized frameworks.

### U.S. Regulatory Breakthroughs  

The U.S. Senate's bipartisan passage of the **GENIUS Act** marks a pivotal moment for stablecoin regulation. This legislation establishes clear issuance guidelines while defining federal and state oversight responsibilities. Although pending House approval, the bill signals Washington's willingness to integrate digital currencies into mainstream finance. Complementing this progress, the Federal Reserve's removal of "reputation risk" barriers for crypto-exposed banks further indicates regulatory thawing.

Market observers particularly note **Trump administration's commitment to ending Operation Chokepoint 2.0**, which previously hindered crypto-fintech collaborations. These developments collectively create favorable conditions for blockchain enterprises operating under established financial regulations.

### Asian Market Catalysts  

Asia's regulatory evolution proves equally transformative. **Citic Guoan International's recent approval** to provide end-to-end virtual asset services represents Hong Kong's most significant institutional endorsement yet. This milestone demonstrates how traditional financial institutions can serve as gateways for compliant Web3 engagement, lowering entry barriers for institutional investors.

Regional analysts predict a domino effect, with more Asian financial firms likely seeking crypto-adjacent licenses to capitalize on infrastructure development opportunities.

## Market Dynamics Beyond Price Movements  

While Bitcoin's price remains below record highs, its reduced volatility signals maturation. Institutional adoption now drives market dynamics, contrasting with past retail-driven cycles. This shift manifests in two key trends:

1. **Mainstream Payment Integration**  
   Major tech companies resume cryptocurrency payment acceptance, while traditional banks explore stablecoins for internal settlements.

2. **Valuation Paradigm Shift**  
   Crypto-focused companies increasingly derive value from technical capabilities and compliance infrastructure rather than direct crypto exposure. Coinbase's evolution into a Web3 financial infrastructure provider exemplifies this transition.

## Strategic Investment Considerations

Despite bullish momentum, investors must remain vigilant against sector-specific risks:

- **Regulatory Uncertainty**: Divergent global approaches create operational complexities

- **Technological Challenges**: Scalability and interoperability remain ongoing development priorities
