## Why Cryptocurrency Prices Fluctuate  

Cryptocurrency prices are inherently volatile, experiencing constant ups and downs. This volatility stems from their decentralized natureâ€”no single entity controls these assets. Instead, prices are influenced by a mix of factors:  

- **Market sentiment**: News, social media trends, and global events can drive sudden price shifts.  
- **Supply and demand**: Limited supply (e.g., Bitcoinâ€™s 21 million cap) combined with surging demand often leads to price spikes.  
- **Regulatory developments**: Government policies or institutional adoption can either boost or destabilize markets.  
- **Technological advancements**: Upgrades to blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereumâ€™s upgrades) can impact investor confidence.  

For example, Bitcoinâ€™s price surged to record highs in 2021 amid institutional adoption and macroeconomic uncertainty. Conversely, negative regulatory news in China caused a sharp decline the same year. Understanding these dynamics helps investors navigate the risks.

## How to Choose the Right Cryptocurrency  

Selecting a cryptocurrency requires careful research and alignment with your financial goals. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of common options:  

| **Cryptocurrency** | **Volatility Level** | **Use Case**                     |  
|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|  
| **Bitcoin (BTC)**   | High                 | Digital gold, long-term store of value |  
| **Ethereum (ETH)**  | High                 | Smart contracts, decentralized apps (dApps) |  
| **TUSD/DAI**        | Low                  | Stablecoins pegged to USD, ideal for reducing risk |  

**Steps to Decide**:  
1. **Research**: Analyze market trends, whitepapers, and team credibility.  
2. **Risk assessment**: High-volatility assets like BTC/ETH suit risk-tolerant investors, while stablecoins offer stability.  
3. **Diversify**: Spread investments across different asset classes to mitigate risk.  

ðŸ’¡ *Pro Tip*: Start with small investments to test the waters before committing larger sums.

## 24/7 Crypto Trading: Opportunities and Challenges  

Unlike traditional stock markets, cryptocurrency exchanges operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This continuous availability allows traders to react to global events in real-time. However, it also means prices can shift dramatically overnight, requiring constant vigilance.  

### Key Considerations:  
- **Time zones**: Markets respond to news from all regions, not just your local area.  
- **Automated tools**: Use limit orders or stop-loss features to manage trades while offline.  
- **Platform reliability**: Choose exchanges like Bitso, which offer round-the-clock support and security.
