## What Is an NFT Collection?  

An **NFT collection** refers to a curated set of non-fungible tokens stored on a blockchain, each representing a unique digital asset. Unlike fungible cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, NFTs are indivisible and distinct, often symbolizing ownership of digital art, music, virtual real estate, or in-game items.  

Key characteristics of NFT collections include:  
- **Individuality and Rarity**: Each token is one-of-a-kind, with unique attributes that determine its value.  
- **Blockchain Verification**: Ownership and transaction history are transparently recorded on the blockchain, ensuring authenticity.  
- **Creative Diversity**: Collections span themes from generative art to virtual avatars, reflecting the artistic vision of creators.  

NFTs have become cultural phenomena, attracting artists, investors, and collectors eager to participate in this digital revolution.
