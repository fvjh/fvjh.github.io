# THORChain (RUNE) Price, Chart, and Market Cap  

## Understanding THORChain and Its Core Functionality  

THORChain (RUNE) is a decentralized liquidity protocol enabling seamless cross-chain cryptocurrency swaps while maintaining user custody of assets. Unlike traditional exchanges relying on order books, THORChain employs an Automated Market Maker (AMM) model to maintain market prices through asset pool ratios. This approach eliminates intermediaries, ensuring trustless transactions across multiple blockchain networks.  

### Key Features of THORChain  
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Facilitates direct swaps between assets on different blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin to Ethereum).  
- **Decentralized Security**: Secured by nodes staking 1 million RUNE tokens to participate in consensus.  
- **Native Token Utility**: RUNE serves as governance, security, and liquidity provision currency.
