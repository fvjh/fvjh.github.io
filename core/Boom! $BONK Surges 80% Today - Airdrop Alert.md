# Boom! $BONK Surges 80% Today - Airdrop Alert

The cryptocurrency landscape is buzzing again as $BONK, a meme coin built on the Solana blockchain, experiences a dramatic 80% price surge. This explosive movement coincides with major exchange listings on Coinbase and Bybit, reigniting interest in this once-humble digital asset. Let's explore the factors behind this meteoric rise and what it means for investors and blockchain enthusiasts.

## $BONK Goes Wild: A New Era Begins

Imagine waking up to find your digital asset portfolio significantly boosted overnight. That's exactly what happened to $BONK holders when Coinbase and Bybit announced their listings. The token, previously trading at $0.000014, suddenly found itself in the spotlight as it joined elite company alongside Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) on major platforms.

However, there's an important caveat: Coinbase's listing will occur in phases. As they stated, "Once sufficient asset supply is established, our BONK-USD trading pair will launch in stages." Residents of restricted jurisdictions should also note potential limitations on trading access.
